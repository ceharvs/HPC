Summary
===============
Results were not as great as expected.  Not sure why, might be overdoing the threading or removing usefulness and speed of array access with excessive threading.

The problem at 8 cores could be due to overloading the system.  Sometimes with 8 cores there's sort of "catching" when running and random/short delays.
