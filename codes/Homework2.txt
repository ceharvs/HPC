Homework 2.1

Part 1:
Signals - Edited code to include a counter variable for the number of times the exit command has been given.  Once the counter reaches three, the program reaches the "done" stage.

Part 2:
Pipes - Worked out the part for ipc2.c but not the icp1.c file.  Not sure how to buffer multiple strings/values. 

Part 3:
Threads - Unable to get threads working properly.  Same issues from class.


Homework 2.2

Part 1: Forks has been updated so the master computes the sum of 2*i or i=1:n.

Part 2: Sockets - need to figure out how to send a number with sockets.

Part 3: OMP - Before running the code, use export OMP_NUM_THREADS=5 to specify the number of threads.  For this code, the basic timing results are:
OMP_NUM_THREADS=1
user time: 26.770s

OMP_NUM_THREADS=2
user time: 13.452s

OMP_NUM_THREADS=4
user time: 6.885s

OMP_NUM_THREADS=8
user time: 3.432s
