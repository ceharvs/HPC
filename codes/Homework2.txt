Homework 2.1

Part 1:
Signals - Edited code to include a counter variable for the number of times the exit command has been given.  Once the counter reaches three, the program reaches the "done" stage.

Part 2:
Pipes - Worked out the part for ipc2.c but not the icp1.c file.  Not sure how to buffer multiple strings/values. 

Part 3:
