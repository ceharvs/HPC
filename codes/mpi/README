1) need to generate ssh keys in order to ssh without a password:
ssh-keygen -t rsa [ENTER] [ENTER...]
cp ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
now you can ssh to another host without being asked for a password

2) edit: ~/.mpd.conf
   add: MPD_SECRETWORD=secretword
   permissions: chmod 600 ~/.mpd.conf

3) compile and run using mpirun and a hostfile
